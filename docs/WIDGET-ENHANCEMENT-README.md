# Widget Enhancement: Partial Lead Capture & Attribution Tracking

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive enhancement to the DH Portal widget system, implementing partial lead capture, complete attribution tracking (including GCLID), and form continuation functionality.

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables

#### 1. `partial_leads` Table
Stores incomplete widget form submissions for lead nurturing and conversion tracking.

```sql
CREATE TABLE partial_leads (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    company_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    session_id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    form_data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    step_completed VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'address_validated',
    service_area_data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    attribution_data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days') NOT NULL,
    converted_to_lead_id UUID REFERENCES leads(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

**Key Fields:**
- `session_id`: Unique identifier linking to widget_sessions
- `form_data`: JSON containing address, pest issue, contact info
- `step_completed`: Tracks progress ('address_validated', 'contact_started')
- `service_area_data`: Service area validation results
- `attribution_data`: Complete UTM, GCLID, and referrer tracking
- `converted_to_lead_id`: Links to full lead if user completes form

#### 2. `widget_sessions` Table
Manages user sessions across widget interactions for analytics and form recovery.

```sql
CREATE TABLE widget_sessions (
    session_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    company_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_agent TEXT,
    ip_address INET,
    referrer_url TEXT,
    page_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    first_visit_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    last_activity_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true NOT NULL
);
```

### Enhanced Tables

#### `leads` Table Enhancements
Added fields for linking to partial leads and comprehensive attribution tracking:

- `partial_lead_id`: Links back to original partial submission
- `gclid`: Google Ads Click Identifier
- `attribution_data`: Complete attribution context (JSONB)
- Enhanced UTM field support with automatic population

## Attribution Tracking System

### GCLID Implementation
Comprehensive Google Ads Click ID tracking with multiple extraction methods:

1. **Primary**: Extract from URL parameter `?gclid=`
2. **Google Ads Conversion Cookies**: Parse from `_gac_*` cookies with format validation
3. **Google Analytics Enhanced**: Extract from GA4 and Universal Analytics cookies
4. **GTM Conversion Linker**: Check various `_gcl_*` cookies (`_gcl_au`, `_gcl_aw`, etc.)
5. **Data Layer Integration**: Extract from GTM dataLayer events
6. **Cross-domain Tracking**: Handle Google Ads linker parameters (`_gl`) and URL fragments
7. **GTM Cross-Domain Linker**: Parse from `_ga` linker format
8. **Custom Cross-Domain**: Support for `xd_gclid` and `cross_gclid` parameters

### Enhanced GCLID Validation
- **Prefix Validation**: Checks for known GCLID prefixes (`CjwK`, `Cj0K`, `EAIa`, etc.)
- **Format Validation**: Validates character patterns and minimum length requirements
- **Integrity Checks**: Ensures GCLID format compliance before persistence

### UTM Parameter Capture
Complete UTM parameter tracking:
- `utm_source`: Traffic source (google, facebook, linkedin, etc.)
- `utm_medium`: Traffic medium (cpc, paid, organic, etc.)
- `utm_campaign`: Campaign identifier
- `utm_term`: Keyword/search term
- `utm_content`: Ad content identifier

### Traffic Source Intelligence
Automatic lead source determination based on attribution data:

```typescript
// Lead source mapping logic
gclid present → 'google_cpc'
utm_source=facebook + utm_medium=paid → 'facebook_ads'
utm_source=linkedin → 'linkedin'
organic search referrers → 'organic'
social media referrers → 'social_media'
