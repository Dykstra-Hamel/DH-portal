-- COMPREHENSIVE RLS POLICY CLEANUP AND OPTIMIZATION
-- This migration completely resolves all RLS performance issues by:
-- 1. Removing all conflicting/duplicate policies
-- 2. Creating single optimized policy per operation per table
-- 3. Optimizing all auth function calls
-- 4. Cleaning up duplicate indexes
